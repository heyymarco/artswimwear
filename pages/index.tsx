                        ART is an acronym for Atika and Rossalia Tomlinson, they are best friends from
                        high school. In 2019, they decided to follow their dreams and launch ART – their
                        own sustainable swimwear brand. Their vision was to create a reversible swimwear
                        range by combining eco friendly materials with various Indonesian batik and
                        weaving designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both Atika and Rossalia are passionate about the conservation of Indonesia’s
                        beautiful oceans, beaches and communities. The girls wanted ART to team up with
                        Art and Nature community whose aim is to empower the people of Indonesia with
                        the skills and education needed to integrate sustainability into their communities
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, by introducing ART ethnic swimwear to the world stage we all really
                        can be “<strong>At one with ART and nature.</strong>”

                                        are collected around the globe through
                                        different initiatives such as Healthy Seas.
                                        From 2013 to 2018, they collected 453
                                        tons of fishing nets, which equals the

                                        The yarn is blended with Lycra® Xtra

                                starts with rescuing waste, like fishing

                                industrial plastic from landfills and
                                oceans all over the world. That waste
                                is then sorted and cleaned to recover
                                all of the nylon possible.

                                original purity. That means ECONYL®
                                regenerated nylon is exactly the same as virgin nylon.

                                carpet yarn and textile yarn for the

                                The beauty of ECONYL® regenerated
                                nylon is that it has the potential to be
                                recycled infinitely, without ever losing
                                its quality. We believe circular design
                                is the future and using ECONYL® is
                                our first step on that journey.
